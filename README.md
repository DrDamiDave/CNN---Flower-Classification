# CNN---Flower-Classification
This project demonstrates how convolutional neural networks can effectively classify images into distinct categories, leveraging data preprocessing, a well-structured CNN architecture, and techniques like data augmentation. The combination of these elements results in a robust model capable of achieving high accuracy in flower classification tasks.
